It is a hereditary disorder that affects the way an individual perceives colors, making it difficult for them to distinguish between certain colors, especially red and green. According to Colour Blind Awareness (2023), color blind people face many difficulties in everyday life which normally sighted people just are not aware of. </p><h4 data-v-23a8df42>Problems with Color Vision Deficiency</h4><p data-v-23a8df42> Problems can arise in even the simplest of activities including choosing and preparing food, gardening, sport, driving a car and selecting which clothes to wear. Color blind people can also find themselves in trouble because they have not properly understood information in the workplace or not noticed themselves/their child getting sunburnt. This means that the condition can have a significant impact on an individual&#39;s daily life, including their ability to perform tasks that require color perception. </p><h4 data-v-23a8df42>Encounter with Color Vision Deficiency</h4><p data-v-23a8df42> The researchers encountered people with color blindness and were experiencing a great challenge in everyday life. A student of St. Maryâ€™s College of Meycauayan is one of the subjects of the researchers. Based on his experience it is hard for him to perceive colors especially with red and green pigments. The experiences of the subject has caught the attention of the researchers and they decided to conduct research about color blindness and come up with the goal of making a website that will aim to spread awareness about color blindness and help the people with color blindness access websites easily and with comfortability. </p><h4 data-v-23a8df42>Types of Colorblind</h4><ul data-v-23a8df42><li data-v-23a8df42>Protan</li><li data-v-23a8df42>Deutan</li><li data-v-23a8df42>Tritan</li><li data-v-23a8df42>Achromat</li></ul>",8),g={class:"about__colorblind-design-left"},E=["src"],I={class:"about__colorblind-design-right"},B=["src"],u=t((()=>(0,o._)("section",{class:"about__inspire"},[(0,o._)("h3",null,"What does this tell for the future?"),(0,o._)("p",null," It is without a doubt a critical aspect of deficiency that is not only pertaining to normal vision, but people with color vision deficiency sacrifices half of the experience on the internet as well as in the enviroment.
